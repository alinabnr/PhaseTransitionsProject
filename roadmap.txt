Overall Objective

Investigate critical slowing down and dynamic critical behavior of the 2D Ising model using:
- Metropolis (local updates)
- Wolff (cluster updates, with optional external field)
- Measure magnetization, energy, and susceptibility
- Extract autocorrelation times and the dynamic critical exponent \(z\) for both algorithms.


Roles and	Main focus
A – Metropolis lead
  * Implement and run the Metropolis algorithm with optional field.
  * Implementation, data generation (M, E, χ), autocorrelation analysis for Metropolis.
B – Wolff lead
  * Implement and run Wolff cluster algorithm (focus on zero field; coordinate with C for field).
  * Cluster building, data generation, τ measurement.
C – Wolff assistant & analysis coordinator
  * Help implement external field in Wolff, manage susceptibility analysis & data processing for both algorithms.
  * Adds χ analysis, final scaling fits, report integration.


Timeline: 3 weeks

Week 1 — Implementation & Verification
Goals:
- Implement both algorithms
- Test on small lattices (e.g., \(L = 16, 32\))
- Verify correctness via known results (⟨M⟩, ⟨E⟩ vs. T)

Tasks
A (Metropolis)
  * Implement standard local Metropolis update.
  * Validate with known energy/magnetization profiles.
  * Implement optional external field term.
  * Prepare scripts to measure M(t), E(t).
B (Wolff)
  * Implement cluster identification and flipping at h=0.
  * Validate with ⟨M⟩(T).
  * Calculate autocorrelation (C_M(t)).
C (assistant)
  * Help B include external field term in Wolff acceptance.
  * Set up shared analysis code for autocorrelation and error estimation. 
  * Define output data formats (JSON or CSV).

Deliverables by end of Week 1:
- Both algorithms producing valid equilibrium data.
- M(T), E(T) curves for small lattices.
- Working autocorrelation computation function.

                                               
Week 2 — Data Collection
Goals:
- Generate long simulation runs.
- Compute ⟨M⟩, ⟨E⟩, variance for χ.
- Begin measuring autocorrelation times τ_M and τ_E.
- Compare algorithms qualitatively.

Tasks
A (Metropolis)
  * Simulate at T = 2.0–2.6 in steps of 0.05.
  * Collect M(t), E(t) for L = 16, 32, 64.
  * Compute autocorrelation τ_M(T), τ_E(T).
B (Wolff)
  * Same temperature range and sizes.
  * Record M(t) after each cluster flip.
  * Compute τ_M(T), τ_E(T).
C (assistant)
  * Extract ⟨M^2⟩
                                               
Deliverables by end of Week 2:
- Time series data for M, E on all L.
- Preliminary plots of τ(T) and χ(T).
- Confirmed agreement of Metropolis vs. Wolff equilibrium curves.

                                               
Week 3 — Scaling Analysis & Report Preparation
Goals:
- Perform finite-size scaling analysis.
- Extract dynamic critical exponents.
- Compare algorithmic efficiency.
- Finalize presentation/plots.

Tasks
A (Metropolis)
  * Fit τ_M(L) ∼ L^z → extract z_Metro.
  * Compare τ_M vs. τ_E near T_c.
  * Draft result section for Metropolis.
B (Wolff)	• Fit τ_M(L) ∼ L^z → extract z_Wolff.
  * Compare z values; include autocorrelation visualizations.
  * Note computational cost per decorrelated sample.
C (assistant)
  * Aggregate and polish χ(T) curves, highlight χ peaks vs. T.
  * Summarize efficiency: τ_eff = τ_int × time per sweep.
  * Write analytical discussion + final report synthesis.

Deliverables by end of Week 3:
- Plots of τ_M(T), τ_E(T), χ(T) for each algorithm.
- Scaling plots (log τ vs log L) → z extraction.

                                               
Expected results:
Metropolis	~2.1
  * Local dynamics, severe slowing down
Wolff	~0.3
  * Nonlocal cluster updates, much faster decorrelation
